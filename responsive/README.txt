I chose to use the max width of the Samsung Galaxy S3 and the max height of the
iphone 5 (1280x1136px); these were the two largest numbers I saw on mobile devices(not
tablets).  I felt like this would capture a variety of different devices I
tested it on my computer using chrome and my Samsung Galaxy Nexus(vzw).  Both
were a success.
